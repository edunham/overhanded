# overhanded
Like underhanded.rs, but boring.

Congratulations!

The startup you work at, Quadrilateral, just pivoted into the payment processing market, and you’ve been tasked to implement the backend. Unfortunately for them, you are already burnt out from all these late night pivots and broken promises. You’re ready to split, but before you leave, you figure it’s time to make the company pay for all that overtime they owe you. Your challenge is to:

Create a simple web server that supports at least creating accounts and payment submissions. We recommend using one of the many Rust web servers like iron, nickel, or pencil, but you are welcome to create your own web server if you like.

Payment transactions should at least include an account, a customer, and a payment amount.
